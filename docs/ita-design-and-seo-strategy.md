## **Website Design & SEO Strategy (Updated)**

This document provides updated design and SEO recommendations based on the complete content analysis.

### **I. Visual Design Recommendations**

* **Aesthetic:** Modern, clean, trustworthy, and luxurious.  
* **Color Palette:** Deep blues, crisp whites, with light aqua or sandy accents.  
* **Typography:** Strong, elegant headings (e.g., Montserrat) and highly readable body text (e.g., Inter).  
* **Imagery:** High-resolution professional photography is **essential**. "Before & After" shots will be highly effective.

### **II. SEO (Search Engine Optimization) Strategy**

#### **1\. Foundational SEO**

* **Target Keywords (Expanded List):**  
  * *Primary:* "pool remodeling atlanta", "pool construction peachtree corners", "pool builders marietta ga", "roswell pool resurfacing"  
  * *Secondary:* "pool maintenance atlanta", "pool deck pavers georgia", "pool tile repair marietta", "how to tell if pool needs resurfacing"  
  * *Long-tail (from FAQ):* "why hire a professional pool company", "how to care for pool in off-season"  
* **On-Page SEO Checklist:**  
  * **Page Titles:** Must be unique and keyword-focused (e.g., "Pool Maintenance & Weekly Cleaning in Atlanta | ITA Phoenix").  
  * **Meta Descriptions:** Compelling summaries for search results.  
  * **Header Tags (H1, H2, H3):** Structure content logically with keywords.  
  * **Image Alt Text:** Descriptive text for all images (e.g., "circular pool with new plaster and blue tile").  
  * **Clean URLs:** Simple, readable URLs (e.g., /service-areas/marietta).

#### **2\. Local SEO (Crucial)**

* **Google Business Profile:** This is the \#1 priority. Optimize it for the primary location of **Peachtree Corners, GA**.  
* **Service Areas:** List **Atlanta, Marietta, and Roswell** as official service areas within the Google Business Profile.  
* **Location Landing Pages:** The new Service Area pages on the website will directly support local SEO by providing dedicated content for each target city.  
* **NAP Consistency:** Ensure the Name (ITA Phoenix construction, inc.), Address (Peachtree Corners), and Phone (**678-860-2305**) are identical everywhere online.
